As you figure out how to use multiple modules, add details here.\nFor code snippets you want to exclude from any packages, use: #| hide\nFor snippets to include and export: #| export\nBefore commiting your changes to GitHub we recommend running nbdev_prepare in the terminal, which bundles the following commands:\n\nnbdev_export: Builds the .py modules from Jupyter notebooks\nnbdev_test: Tests your notebooks\nnbdev_clean: Cleans your notebooks to get rid of extreanous output for git\nnbdev_readme: Updates your repo’s README.md file from your index notebook.",
