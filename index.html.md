``` sh
$ pip install mrcnn_line_segmentation
```

### Documentation

Documentation can be found hosted on this GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/sethdroberts/mrcnn_line_segmentation)’s
[pages](https://sethdroberts.github.io/mrcnn_line_segmentation/).
Additionally you can find package manager specific guidelines on

[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/mrcnn_line_segmentation/) respectively.

## How to use

First, create virtual environment:

``` python
# python -m venv venv/
```

Second, activate it:

``` python
# source venv/bin/activate
```

Thirdly, install requirements:

``` python
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install hooks for nbdev:

``` python
# nbdev_install_hooks
```

Once setup completed, do all coding in 00_core. As you figure out how to
use multiple modules, add details here.

For code snippets you want to exclude from any packages, use: `#| hide`

For snippets to include and export: `#| export`

Before commiting your changes to GitHub we recommend running
nbdev_prepare in the terminal, which bundles the following commands:

- `nbdev_export`: Builds the .py modules from Jupyter notebooks
- `nbdev_test`: Tests your notebooks
- `nbdev_clean`: Cleans your notebooks to get rid of extreanous output
  for git
- `nbdev_readme`: Updates your repo’s README.md file from your index
  notebook.
